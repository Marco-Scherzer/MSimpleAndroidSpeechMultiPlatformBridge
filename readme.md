#### I originally developed Android Speech Multiplatform Bridge in Summer 2025 (two weeks) to use Android speech recognition within
#### JavaFX/Gluon.It became my first Android‑specific project.
#### As of Dec. 30, 2025, it has reached approx. 2 weeks of progress (1.commit).

#### External dependencies: nanohttpd-2.3.1.jar (because my own http-server https://github.com/Marco-Scherzer/MSimpleServer is not yet completely debugged on android. This might change in the future)
#### Development of MSimpleAndroidSpeechMultiPlatformBridge started in Summer 2025 (two weeks)  and had reached approx. 2 weeks of progress when it started to work for my own simple scenario purposes.
#### Features after 2 weeks:
- **Speech Recognition Server for Android: Enables Client Devices running on non Android Systems to use the Android Speech Recognition**
- **Pairing-like https connections: Allows only 1:1 connections between device and Android-Device**
- **Platform Independent Java Client Code**
- **Server plus Client Surface for testing**

#### Since Dec. 30, 2025, I decided to develop MSimpleAndroidSpeechMultiPlatformBridge on GitHub, continuing from this point.
#### Note: Because I use Git as an addition to my history for proof of authorship, I regularly commit things in my (anyway *to treat as private*) repositories in an unready state (nothing works).

# Declaration to Avoid Scamming, Theft of Intellectual Property, and Deception by Fraudsters

To prevent scamming, theft of intellectual property, and the deception of persons by fraudulent
actions, I hereby make the following statement once and for all, clearly and explicitly:

**Please note:** I never grant any permissions, not in the past, not now, and not in the future.

## 1. Abuse and Phishing

To protect against abuse and phishing, please note:
There are **no other websites, email addresses, or communication channels** associated with this software except the official contact listed here.

If you encounter the code or binaries anywhere other than:

- Wayback Machine (pre‑publication archiving of of this repository's content and URLs)
- https://archive.today/ and https://archive.ph/ (pre‑publication archiving of of this repository's content and URLs)

## 2. False Claims of Involvement or Permission

Any false claim by any person to be in any way involved in my projects, or to have received any
permission from me – whether for usage, reproduction, replication, especially of APIs,
functionality, modularity, architecture, or for public display – is untrue and constitutes a *
*serious criminal offense**.

This includes in particular:

- Scamming and fraudulent deception
- Theft of intellectual property
- Always implicit defamation of the true author of a work and his business, since the truth about
  the origin of a work is reputation‑critical

I explicitly declare that I **never grant any licenses of any kind for an open source work and
especially not for its code – not in the past, not now, and not in the future.**
